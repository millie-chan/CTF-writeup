# Leviathan Level 0 → Level 1
ssh leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
ls -al /etc/leviathan_pass
found that only the user of that level can access that file
as mentioned in task, check home directory
ls -al /home
you will find that every one could read and access(the x permission of direcory) leviathan* folder, let's access to level 0 first
ls -al /home/leviathan0
ls -al /home/leviathan0/.backup
cat /home/leviathan0/.backup/bookmarks.html
it's a large file, let's use grep
cat /home/leviathan0/.backup/bookmarks.html | grep leviathan1
the password for leviathan1 is PPIfmI1qsA

# Leviathan Level 1 → Level 2
ssh leviathan1@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
ls -al /home/leviathan1
there is a s in permission, go to google, it means we can use leviathan1 to run this program as if we were leviathan2
  looks like we will need it to check the password in /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
cat /home/leviathan1/check
it is a binary file, try grep first, nothing
be brave to run it
/home/leviathan1/check
it shows "password:", then try leviathan1 password first
then it returns "Wrong password, Good Bye ...", looks like it read the content of /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
