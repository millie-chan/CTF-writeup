  base64 decode is easy, you could even use browser console tool to decode it.

  it looks like substitution cipher related, can google caesar cipher or rot13
  and bingo, it is rot13

./encrypt
  usage: encrypt foo  - where foo is the file containing the plaintext
cat README
  encrypt will read /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat and then write a result file
  but we dont have write permission on /krypton/krypton2
  therefore we need to create a folder in /tmp and run command there
mkdir /tmp/temp20240606
cd /tmp/temp20240606
echo "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" > data
ln -s /krypton/krypton2/keyfile.dat keyfile.dat
/krypton/krypton2/encrypt data
ls -al
cat ciphertext
  MNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKL
  A->M is 12, which means this time is rot12, to revert it we need rot(26-12)

  after reading README
    1) we need to use found1, found2 and found3 to find the key
    2) and then use the key to decode krypton4
    3) there are 2 hint files but i dont want to read it
  if you dont want to spend time on it, you can goolge some decipher which can calculate the possible key for you
  such as https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution and https://planetcalc.com/8047/
cat found1
cat found2
cat found3
  most of them are 5 chars, only 1 with 4 chars and 1 with 2 chars, not sure if we could count on them so ignore them first
  my plan is, list the 5-char word I know and with similar chars, and then try to match the words in those 3 found files
  THERE, THREE, THEIR, THINK, THING, WHERE
  first, THERE vs THREE, which are same 5 chars with different position
  i dont want to check all of them with my own eyes, let's write a js script to do it
  https://jsfiddle.net/5an3wuLz/2/
  analyze "thereVsWhere UKSNS WKSNS" first, the first two chars should match one of the thinkVsThing pairs
  but no UK or WK prefix there, which means it possibly not correct
  analyze "thereVsTheir JDSNY JDSYS", the first two chars are JD,
  there are two pairs of them: "thinkVsThing JDSQV JDSQE" and "thinkVsThing JDSNB JDSNY", none of them match
  but JDE really looks like THE...at the end we still need third party tool
put found1 + found2 + found3 in either website mentioned above
  got a passage with strange space
  IN CRYPTOGRAPHY A CAESAR CIPHER ALSO KNOWN AS A CAESARS CIPHER
  THE SHIFT CIPHER CAESARS CODE OR CAESAR SHIFT IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST WIDELY KNOWN ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES
  from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
  so the decryption key is BOIHGKNQVTWYURXZAJEMSLDFPC

  well done the level four password is brute
  i did it other's brute force XD
after reading the hint, what if we try https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/frequency-analysis-breaking-the-code.html
  it's more difficult and time-consuming to solve by myself

  key length = 6
  to be honest, without the correct place of spaces, can i really run the frequency-analysis to get the decrypted message?
